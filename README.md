# GHH22_EmployeeEmpowerment

This is Alice Nolan, Madelyn Khoury and Parul Goswami's 2022 Girls Hoo Hack: Hack to the Future Project Submission. 

Specific git commits were not able to be done due to compatibility difficulties and time restraints with the project with the platform Google Colab. Thus, we created the this document here. 

The following contributions were made by each group member: 


Parul Goswami 
- Research on which dataset to choose
- Research on which concept to go for (gender pay gap)
- Data Cleaning + Data Visualization (heat maps, correlations, etc) 
- Feature Engineering
- Inertia vs. K implementations
- Devpost + slides work
- Live demo

Alice Nolan
- Research on which dataset to choose
- Research on which concept to go for (gender pay gap)
- Data Cleaning + Pipelines
- Feature Engineering for JobGroup column
- Debugging of Issues
- Implemented kmeans algorithm
- Edited pyplot graph appearances
- Create pyplots for each cluster
- Worked on description of project on devpost/presentation

Madelyn Khoury
- Research on gender pay gap
- Ideating possible ML methods (regression, classification, etc.) and model (SVM, K-Means) to solve problem
- Encoding of categorical data
- Other Data Cleaning
- Extracted and displayed statistics from each cluster (mean and std. dev for numerical features, value count percentages for categorical features)
- Created visualizations of clusters by color, using different shades for men and women
- Created visualization method to plot percent of women per cluster vs other numerical features
- Worked on Devpost and slides
- Live demo

All group members did the following: 
- Brainstormed and discussed ideas 
- debugged/helped research solves to errors 
- devpost
- live demo
- presentation!
