# GHH22_EmployeeEmpowerment

This is Alice Nolan, Madelyn Khoury and Parul Goswami's 2022 Girls Hoo Hack: Hack to the Future Project Submission. 

Specific git commits were not able to be done due to compatibility difficulties and time restraints with the project with the platform Google Colab. Thus, we created the this document here. 

The following contributions were made by each group member: 


Parul Goswami 
- Research on which dataset to choose
- Research on which concept to go for (gender pay gap)
